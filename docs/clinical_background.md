Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer mortality in the USA and worldwide [1]. A critical question in the management of PCa is in distinguishing aggressive cancer from indolent disease. Characterization of tumor aggressiveness relies on histo-pathological analysis of biopsy samples [2]. In the recent years, targeted sampling of suspected cancer areas has emerged as an effective personalized alternative to the systematic sextant biopsy [3]. Such targeted approaches require multiparametric MRI(mpMRI) for localizing suspected regions, which are then re-identified using image registration in the intra-procedural imaging. MRI can also be used as the intra-procedural imaging modality, as it provides superior visualization of the needle, anatomy and suspicious regions [4]. However, prostate motion during biopsy, which can last for over an hour for in-bore procedures, can complicate localization of the suspected lesion. Continuous tracking of the prostate may thus be required to enable accurate targeting.
