# Upgrade

It is currently not possible to upgrade SliceTracker without upgrading the 3D Slicer application.

If you need to upgrade the software, download the latest nightly release of 3D Slicer and install the SliceTracker extension following [installation instructions](docs/user_guide/install.md).
