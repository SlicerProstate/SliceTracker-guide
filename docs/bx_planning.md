# Biopsy plan preparation

To prepare the biopsy plan, you need to:

1. create a new case
2. load the pre-procedural data
2. prepare pre-procedural data

We will walk you through those steps.

**WARNING**: If you have pre-procedural data that will be used for biopsy target placement, you must complete biopsy plan preparation before the intra-procedural images could be sent to SliceTracker!
