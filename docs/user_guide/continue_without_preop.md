# Continue without pre-procedural image data

No information from pre-procedural images about targets are available, which means that SliceTracker switches to a `Target Placement Mode` where the user has to place targets on intra-procedural images.

SliceTracker automatically activated the `Target Placement Mode` which is indicated by the ![](../images/fiducialmode_icon.png) cursor. Fiducial placement is done by clicking onto image locations that correspond to biopsy targets.

| Created target appears in the main UI target table with its initial name. | Double click onto the name cell of the target that you want to rename. |

After you finished setting and renaming of targets, click the checkmark button \( ![](/assets/icon-apply.png) \) below the target table. Following this click the `Finish Step` button SliceTracker switches to the overview mode and waiting for the incoming `Needle` images.
