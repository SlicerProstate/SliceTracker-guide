# Continue without pre-procedural image data

Since no information from pre-procedural images about targets are available, SliceTracker will switch to a `Target Placement Mode`, where the user will have to place targets on intra-procedural images.

To do so, SliceTracker already activated the `Target Placement Mode` which is indicated by the ![](../images/fiducialmode_icon.png) cursor. Click image locations to place fiducials corresponding to biopsy targets.

| Created target appears in the main UI target table with its initial name. | Double click onto the name cell of the target that you want to rename. |

After you finished setting and renaming of targets, click the checkmark button \( ![](/assets/icon-apply.png) \) below the target table. Following this click the "Finish Step" button SliceTracker will switch to the overview mode and will wait for the incoming `Needle` images.
