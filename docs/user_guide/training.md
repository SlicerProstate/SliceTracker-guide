# Training

In order to be able to do training in SliceTracker, you will just need to start a new case. The following image shows the UI of SliceTracker after creating a new case.

On the left side you will find a collapsible button "Training" that you need to open. 

Click onto "Simulate preop phase" and example data will get downloaded and imported to SliceTracker. 

Once you get back from preprocessing the data with mpReview, you will need to click "Simulate intraop phase".
