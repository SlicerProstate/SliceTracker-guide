# AMIGO-specific setup

To set up SliceTracker in [AMIGO](http://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/amigo/default.aspx), you need to:

* connect the MacBook directly to the yellow ethernet cable coming from the ethernet outlet next to the MR-workstation \(under the table\)
* apply the network configuration \(see Network configuration details\)
* use `AMIGO-CLIENT-4` on the MR console as the destination to send the data

NOTE: there is an internal port forwarding configured in the Macbook which forwards incoming data on port 104 to port 11112.

### Network configuration details

| Configuration parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
